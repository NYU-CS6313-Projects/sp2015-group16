### Abstract
UNICEF is a United Nations Program headquartered in New York City that provides long-term humanitarian and developmental assistance to children and mothers in developing countries. This project is created to help the UNICEF employees understand the evolutions of various topics happening around the world so that they can coordinate resources and create targeted campaigns strategically. We were provided about 5200 news bulletins in year 2013 and the second half year of 2014. Through performing topic modeling using LDA and K-Means Clustering, we categorized the news in 8 topics, and then visualized the topic trends using world map, bar chart, time slider and line plot. One finding we had was that conflicts occurred frequently during 2013-2014, especially in Africa and Middle East.

Data is provided by UNICEF.
