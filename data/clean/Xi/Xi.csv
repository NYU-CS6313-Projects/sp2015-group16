A non-pneumatic anti-shock garment (NASG) - also called a “lifewrap” - is a half-body suit that is strapped onto a woman’s lower legs and abdomen to slow bleeding and prevent shock due to blood loss. “It [the lifewrap] works in two ways: it compresses the blood vessels in the lower part of the body, reversing shock by giving back oxygen to the heart, lungs and brain which are very oxygen-dependent tissues,” said Suellen Miller, director of the Safe Motherhood Programme/Bixby Centre for Global Reproductive Health at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) in the USA. If it works as intended, pressure on the abdomen decreases the radius of the blood vessels and reduces overall bleeding.

Mexico's Senate overwhelmingly passed a sweeping reform of the dysfunctional public school system early on Wednesday, handing Nieto an important victory in his push to remake some of his country's worst-run institutions. The late-night vote clears a path for Pena Nieto to move forward with a series of even more controversial reforms, including a measure that would violate one of modern Mexico's longest-standing taboos by allowing private investment in the state-run oil company. Education advocates say a series of concessions to the National Education Workers' Coordinating Committee (CNTE), one of the two main teachers unions, undermined the reform's ability to create true change in the national education system.",Al Jazeera - http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2013/09/20139582129838598.html

One of Asia's best performing economies had been on track for growth well above 7.0% for the full year, but the government said Super Typhoon Haiyan was expected to cut up to 0.8% points from the final quarter. Nevertheless, the Filipino President's administration said the economy remained well placed, pointing out the third quarter was the fifth straight three-month period in which growth was at 7.0% or above. ""This solid growth demonstrates the continuing resilience of the economy in the face of global economic challenges and natural calamities,"" said the Finance Secretary. One of the worst-performing sectors in the third quarter was agriculture, which grew by just 0.3% year-on-year. The National Statistical Coordination Board secretary general said this was partly due to damage to farms from 10 typhoons and tropical storms that struck the country during those three months.

Scientists based at Sweden's Lund University say the new strain, known as A3/O2, is a cross between the two most common strains in Guinea-Bissau. Their study found people infected with the new strain develop AIDS in about five years, more than a year faster than people with one of the initial strains alone. They say people with A3/02 are also three times more likely to develop AIDS and suffer an AIDS-related death. The university says that so far, the new strain has been identified only in West Africa. But it notes that around the globe, other strains are combining, raising the risk of harder-to-treat strains of HIV. The findings were based on a study of 152 people with HIV in Guinea-Bissau.

1299,GENERAL,Across Regions,2013-12-02 00:00:00,Addressing gender issues in conflict and humanitarian action,"A new Oxfam policy paper warns that if humanitarian interventions are not planned with gender dynamics in mind, the needs of those most under threat may not be adequately met. Humanitarian crises can affect women, men, girls and boys in radically different ways; changing social and cultural structures, and redefining women’s and men’s statuses – in both positive and negative ways. If humanitarian interventions are not planned with gender dynamics in mind, the needs of those most under threat may not be adequately met, and an opportunity to support positive change will be lost. That is why gender equality is central to humanitarian action. To address the different impacts of conflict and disasters on men, women, boys and girls and promote the potential for positive transformation of gender norms, humanitarian agencies must analyse, plan, and respond to crises in ways that address practical gender needs and promote women’s rights. Indeed all actors involved in emergencies – including donors, humanitarian agencies, governments, and civil society organisations - must promote gender equality as part of any response.

The inaugration of 44-year-old Margvelashvili, a philosopher and former university rector, as president on 17 November marked the end of the decade-long presidency of Mikheil Saakashvili who put the country on the path toward integration with the European Union. Margvelashvili, who won last month's presidential election with 62 percent of the vote, expressed his commitment to democracy, EU integration and the strategic partnership with the US, in his inaugral address. He said Georgians would continue to do their part in the international fight against terrorism, despite the losses sustained in Afghanistan, where Georgia is the largest non-NATO contributor of troops to the NATO-led mission. The new president has little political experience and is seen as beholden to Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, whose coalition drove Saakashvili's party from power in last year's parliamentary election.",Aljazeera - http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2013/11/georgia-swears-new-president-2013111712756245793.html

The same tactic was employed four times by Maduro's mentor and predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez, to promulgate dozens of laws that dramatically boosted state control over the economy. But unlike the charismatic Chavez, who had near-absolute command over his party, doubts about Maduro's leadership have risen since he defeated opposition leader Henrique Capriles by a razor-thin margin in April's presidential election and as worsening shortages of basic goods and galloping inflation, now at 54 percent, have eroded popular support for his rule.",AP - http://bigstory.ap.org/article/venezuelas-congress-grants-maduro-decree-powers
