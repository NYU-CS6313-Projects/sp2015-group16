        "South Sudan President Salva Kiir on Wednesday called on rebels to resume peace talks as the country marked its third birthday with celebrations overshadowed by fighting that has killed thousands and brought it to the verge of famine. In a swift response, rebel leader Riek Machar told Reuters in Ethiopia that he was ready to resume dialogue but warned his troops would target South Sudan's oil installations if fighting resumed and the government used oil revenues to buy arms. \"Put down your guns and come home,\" Kiir said in Juba during a ceremony marking the anniversary of independence. \"I still renew my call upon him (Machar) to accept the logic of peaceful resolution to the conflict so that we resolve this issue.\" \"On our side, we are ready to continue negotiations,\" Machar told Reuters in Addis Ababa, adding that he has also called for the talks to be resumed soon.\n",

Previously, the city was largely under the control of the Taliban and militants used it as a base to prepare bombs and plan attacks, said General Zafarullah Khan, the top commander in rugged North Waziristan, which borders Afghanistan.\n",

As many as 6,000 people are believed to have been taking shelter at the church, according to media reports. On 7 July, rebels purportedly entered the site and killed at least 27 people, including women and children. Violence in Bambari has escalated at an alarming rate, according to UN officials, and there is increased targeting of civilians in the area, which is reportedly home to one of the country's Roman Catholic diocese.\n",
