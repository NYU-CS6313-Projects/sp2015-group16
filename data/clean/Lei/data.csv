For now, the Caribbean strain of chikungunya does not seem likely to expand into the rest of the Western Hemisphere, mostly because it is spread by the tropical mosquito Aedes aegypti. However, several major chikungunya outbreaks have been fuelled by a specific mutation of the virus that makes it more suited to transmission by a different species of mosquito. The insect that could cause the damage is the Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus), which has been expanding worldwide for the past two decades and taking diseases such as chikungunya and dengue with it.",
